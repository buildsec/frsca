## About The Project

Factory for Repeatable Secure Creation of Artifacts (FRSCA) is a prototype
implementation of the CNCF's
[Secure Software Factory Reference Architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwyOIDramwCnivuvUxrMmHmCr02ARoA3jw76o1mGfGQ)
which is based on the CNCF's
[Software Supply Chain Best Practices White Paper](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper/CNCF_SSCP_v1.pdf)

The purpose of the project is to provide a set of tools, patterns, and polices
in order to build artifacts with increased confidence around its authenticity
and integrity, and with traceable provenance.

## Quickstart

To quickly provision a Minikube cluster with [Tekton Pipelines], [Tekton
Chains], and the [buildpacks] pipeline, simply run:

```bash
make quickstart
```

Tearing down the Minikube cluster generated in the quickstart, simply run:

```bash
make teardown
```
