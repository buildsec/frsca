## What is a software factory?

A software factory is a structured collection of related software assets that
aids in producing computer software applications or software components
according to specific, externally defined end-user requirements through an
assembly process. A software factory applies manufacturing techniques and
principles to software development to mimic the benefits of traditional
manufacturing. Software factories are generally involved with outsourced
software creation.
