# FRSCA Sample Tekton Pipeline

This is a sample tekton based application build pipeline.

> :warning: This pipeline is not intended to be used in production

Follow these instructions to setup this pipeline and run it against your sample
application repository. In this example, we are going to build and deploy
[tekton-tutorial-openshift](https://github.com/IBM/tekton-tutorial-openshift)
application. You can use `minikube` to run your tekton pipeline and deploy this
application.

## Starting Demo

```bash
# Only if a cluster is needed.
make setup-minikube

# Setup FRSCA environment
make setup-frsca

# Run a new pipeline.
make example-sample-pipeline

# Wait until it completes.
tkn pr logs --last -f

# Export the value of IMAGE_URL from the last taskrun and the taskrun name:
export IMAGE_URL=$(tkn pr describe --last -o jsonpath='{..taskResults}' | jq -r '.[] | select(.name | match("IMAGE_URL$")) | .value')
export TASK_RUN=$(tkn pr describe --last -o json | jq -r '.status.taskRuns | keys[] as $k | {"k": $k, "v": .[$k]} | select(.v.status.taskResults[]?.name | match("IMAGE_URL$")) | .k')

## If using the registry-proxy
# export IMAGE_URL="$(echo "${IMAGE_URL}" | sed 's#'${REGISTRY}'#127.0.0.1:5000#')"

# Double check that the attestation and the signature were uploaded to the OCI.
crane ls "$(echo -n ${IMAGE_URL} | sed 's|:[^/]*$||')"

# Verify the image and the attestation.
cosign verify --key k8s://tekton-chains/signing-secrets "${IMAGE_URL}"
cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance --key k8s://tekton-chains/signing-secrets "${IMAGE_URL}"

# Download the SBOM
cosign download sbom "${IMAGE_URL}"

# Verify the signature and attestation with tkn.
tkn chain signature "${TASK_RUN}"
tkn chain payload "${TASK_RUN}"
```

Once successfully completed. You should be able to see your application deployed
on the cluster

```bash
